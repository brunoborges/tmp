98. Unlock Scalable Edge AI through Federated Learning with Open Horizon and EdgeLake
   Code: 2309
   Type: Technology Breakout
   Abstract: As edge devices—from sensors and cameras to mobile and medical equipment—generate ever-growing volumes of data, centralizing it for machine learning has become costly, slow, and increasingly impractical, especially in privacy-sensitive domains like healthcare. Federated Learning (FL) offers a solution by enabling devices to train models locally and share only model weights—not raw data—preserving privacy and reducing bandwidth. Despite its promise, FL is difficult to deploy at scale. Managing node coordination, data alignment, and distributed infrastructure introduces major complexity. EdgeFL, built on EdgeLake, an open-source LF Edge project, simplifies this by automating the full FL lifecycle—from training and aggregation to inference. Deployable through Open Horizon, EdgeFL supports secure, scalable, hands-free deployment of FL workloads across heterogeneous edge environments. In this talk, we’ll demo two real-world use cases: Healthcare: Deploying EdgeFL with Open Horizon across hospitals to collaboratively train a model without sharing HIPAA-sensitive data. Edge AI: Deploying EdgeFL with Open Horizon to execute real-time object detection through edge inference on lightweight devices. We’ll show how simple it is to deploy EdgeFL with Open Horizon to make federated learning practical and affordable—bringing enterprise-grade ML to standard edge infrastructure.
